Semantic Textual Similarity with TF-IDF
----------------------------------------

This lab computes the similarity of pairs of sentences using a normalized term-document matrix
and cosine similarity.
This technique is evaluated against a gold standard.

Data is from the [STS benchmark](http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark).
